## Machine Vision for Non-Verbal Communication
# Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine vision system that can identify cards with pictures & symbols, and use text-to-speech (TTS) technology to give a non-verbal child a voice. The system will use a camera to capture images of the cards, and then use image recognition algorithms to identify the card's content. Once the content has been identified, the words will be sent to a Chat-GPT type model, where the identified content will be summarized and converted into a sentence representative of the symbols that have been chosen by the child. This sentence is then converted to speech using a TTS engine.

# Methodology

The system will consist of the following components:

    -Camera: A camera will be used to capture images of the cards. The camera will be mounted on a stand, and will be positioned so that it can capture a clear image of the cards.

    -Card Recognition: Image recognition algorithms will be used to identify the cards' content. The cards will have pictures or symbols that represent different objects, actions, or concepts. The machine vision system will be trained to recognize these pictures or symbols, and to convert them into text.

    -Text-to-Speech Engine: A TTS engine will be used to convert the now coherent sentence text into speech.

    -User Interface: The system will have a user interface that is designed for ease of use by the child. For example, a secured webcam positioned above the child communication table.

# Benefits

The machine vision system will provide a means for non-verbal children to communicate with others. By using There Standard pictures or symbols that are commonly printed onto cards, the child can express their needs, wants, and feelings, and the TTS engine will allow them to do so verbally. The system will also be customizable to every child's specific needs and abilities, allowing for a personalized communication system that every non-verbal child can have a unique voice and the models can be trained on there pre-existing PEC cards Thus making the system accessable iregardless of the Picture cards in use because some children with disabilities may associate different meanings to different symbols.

# Conclusion

Machine vision technology has the potential to revolutionize the way non-verbal individuals communicate with others. By using image recognition and TTS technology, this simple project will develop a communication system that can give non-verbal children a Unique voice. The system will be easy to use, customizable, and effective, and will provide a means for non-verbal children to express themselves and interact with the world around them.
